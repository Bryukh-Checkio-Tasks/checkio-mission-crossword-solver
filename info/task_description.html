        “It's from the newspapers that people I know - relatives and co-workers - have got the idea that crosswords are
        a prophylactic against Alzheimer's. Newspapers are of course also the place where crosswords (and now sudokus)
        are most readily available, so the association is presumably good for circulation.”

    A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossword">crossword</a>
    is a word puzzle that normally takes the form of a square or a rectangular grid of white and black
    shaded squares. The goal is to fill the white squares with letters, forming words or phrases, by solving clues which
    lead to the answers. In languages that are written left-to-right, the answer words and phrases are placed in the
    grid from left to right and from top to bottom. The shaded squares are used to separate the words or phrases.

</p>

<p>
    We will solve crosswords which have a lattice-like structure,
    with a higher percentage of shaded squares, leaving up to half the letters in an answer unchecked.
    For example, if the top row has an answer running all the way across,
    there will be no across answers in the second row.
    Your program gets a crossword pattern without clues and numbers, so it should determine word positions itself with
    the follow rules:<br>
    - if a cell is placed in the most left column or neighbour left cell is shady, and neighbour right cell is empty,
    then this cell is the beginning of left-to-right word;<br>
    - if a cell is placed in the top row or neighbour up cell is shady, and neighbour down cell is empty,
    then this cell is the beginning of up-to-down word.<br>
    All words have length more or equal to 3 letters. All empty cells should filled.
</p>
<p>
    You are given a crossword as a sequence of strings, where "X" is shady cell and "." is an empty cell.
    And you are given the predefined list of words in lowercase
    (You can find it
    <a href="https://github.com/Bryukh-Checkio-Tasks/checkio-mission-crossword-solver/blob/master/verification/words.py">here</a> or
    in default code).
    This list is the same for all crosswords and contains
    about 1500 nouns. You should use only the given words.
</p>
<p>
    You don't need to find all possible solutions. It will be enough to find any solution which fills the crossword
    and contains correct words.
