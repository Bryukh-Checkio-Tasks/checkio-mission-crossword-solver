        “Looking at the sky, he suddenly saw that it had become black. Then white again, but with great rippling
        circles. The circles were vultures wheeling around the sun. The vultures disappeared, to be replaced by checkers
        squares ready to be played on. On the board, the pieces moved around incredibly rapidly, winning dozens of games
        every minute. They were scarcely lined up before they started rushing at each other again, banging into each
        other, forming fighting combinations, wiping the other side out in the wink of an eye. Then the squares
        scattered, giving way to the grille of a crossword puzzle, and here, too, words flashed, drove each other away,
        clustered, were erased. They were all very long words, like Catalepsy, Thunderbird, Superrequeteriquísímo and
        Anticonstitutionally. The grille faded away, and suddenly the whole sky was covered with linked words, long
        sentences full of semicolons and inverted commas. For the space of a few seconds, there was this gigantic sheet
        of paper on which were written sentences that moved forward jerkily, changing their meaning, modifying their
        construction, altering completely as they advanced. It was beautiful, so beautiful that nothing like that had
        ever been read anywhere, and yet it was impossible to decipher the writing. It was all about death, or pity, or
        the incredible secrets that are hidden somewhere, at one of the farthest points of time. It was about water,
        too, about vast lakes floating just above the mountains, lakes shimmering under the cold wind. For a split
        second, Y. M. H., by screwing up his eyes, managed to read the writing, but it vanished with lightning speed and
        he could not be sure. It seemed to go like this: There's no reason to be afraid. No, there's no reason to be
        afraid. There's no reason to be afraid. There's no reason to be afraid. No. No, there's no reason to be afraid.
        No, there's no reason to be afraid.”<br>

    A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossword">crossword</a>
    is a word puzzle that normally takes the form of a square or a rectangular grid of white and black
    shaded squares. The goal is to fill the white squares with letters, forming words or phrases, by solving clues which
    lead to the answers. In languages that are written left-to-right, the answer words and phrases are placed in the
    grid from left to right and from top to bottom. The shaded squares are used to separate the words or phrases.

</p>

<p>
    We will solve crosswords which have a lattice-like structure,
    with a higher percentage of shaded squares, leaving up to half the letters in an answer unchecked.
    For example, if the top row has an answer running all the way across,
    there will be no across answers in the second row.
    Your program gets a crossword pattern without clues and numbers, so it should determine word positions itself with
    the follow rules:<br>
    - if a cell is placed in the most left column or neighbour left cell is shady, and neighbour right cell is empty,
    then this cell is the beginning of left-to-right word;<br>
    - if a cell is placed in the top row or neighbour up cell is shady, and neighbour down cell is empty,
    then this cell is the beginning of up-to-down word.<br>
    All words have length more or equal to 3 letters. All empty cells should filled.
</p>
<p>
    You are given a crossword as a sequence of strings, where "X" is shady cell and "." is an empty cell.
    And you are given the predefined list of words in lowercase. This list is the same for all crosswords and contains
    about 1500 nouns. You should use only the given words.
</p>
<p>
    You don't need to find all possible solutions. It will be enough to find any solution which fills the crossword
    and contains correct words.
